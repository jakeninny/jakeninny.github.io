I worked closely with the client to design and develop a personal portfolio website that could be easily managed.

I decided to try something new and build the site using the Grav CMS, which I had been reading about and thought looked like a great lightweight flat file option to use when the right project came along.

I really enjoyed working with it and found it very easy to build a custom site with different post and media types that could easily be edited by the client in the CMS.

What you can't see here is the every changing background colour animation.
