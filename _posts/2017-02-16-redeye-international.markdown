While in London I worked for Red Eye as a "Solutions Engineer" (Front End Developer) within their CRO Team.

In this role I would code experiments for A/B tests primarily in javascript and jQuery. These tests would then be implemented on clients live sites using the Optimizely testing A/B tool.

It involved working closely with the CRO consultants, the UX and design teams to optimise tests and results for the client.

I learnt a lot in a short period of time about coding performance focused jQuery and javascript, and approaching design problems in a way that where both best for the user experience and the client.
