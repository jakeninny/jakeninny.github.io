I worked closely with the client to design and develop a personal portfolio website that could be easily managed.

I decided to try something new and build the site using the Grav CMS, which I had been reading about and thought looked like a great lightweight flat file option to use when the right project came along.

I really enjoyed working with it and found it very easy to build a custom site with different post and media types that could easily be edited by the client in the CMS.
