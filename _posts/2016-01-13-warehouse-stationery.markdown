I was hired on a six month contract to help cover the transition to a new web store built on the Demandware platform.

During this time I worked on several things:
- Creating Landing pages for both the new and old site , notably Apple and the Huawei p9 launch.
- Image editing, banner and web tile creation.
- Daily maintenance and management of the website through the Demandware CMS.
- Testing and implementing promotions.
